# Documentation

## Index Page

This is the main documentation index page.

## Contents

The documentation is organized into the following sections:

* **Functions** - API reference for all exported functions
* **Tutorial** - Step-by-step guide to get started
* **Examples** - Code examples and use cases

## Quick Start

```julia
using MyPackage

# Create a new instance
obj = MyType()

# Call a function
result = process(obj)
```

## Features

* Easy to use API
* High performance
* Well documented

## Admonitions

!!! note "'note' admonition"
    Admonitions look like this. This is a `!!! note`-type admonition.

    Note that admonitions themselves can contain other block-level elements too,
    such as code blocks. E.g.

    ```julia
    f(x) = x^2
    ```

!!! info "'info' admonition"
    This is a `!!! info`-type admonition.

!!! tip "'tip' admonition"
    This is a `!!! tip`-type admonition.

!!! warning "'warning' admonition"
    This is a `!!! warning`-type admonition.

!!! danger "'danger' admonition"
    This is a `!!! danger`-type admonition.

## Headings in Block Context

!!! note "Blocks in block context"

    ```julia
    x^2
    ```

    Headings work in admonitions too.

Also in block quotes:

> ```julia
> x^2
> ```
>
> Quoted code works too.
